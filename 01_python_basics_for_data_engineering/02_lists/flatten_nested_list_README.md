# Flatten a Nested List

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to **flatten a nested list** into a single list of elements.

## Approach:
- We define a function `flatten()` that accepts a nested list as input.
- The function iterates over each sublist and extracts its elements, adding them to the final list.
- The resulting list contains all elements of the original nested list in a flat structure.

### Example:
Input: `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]`

Output: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

## How to Run:
```bash
python lists/flatten_nested_list.py
```
