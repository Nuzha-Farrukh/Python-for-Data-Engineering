# 🐍 Python Basics for Data Engineering

This repository contains a set of **mini Python exercises** designed to reinforce core programming concepts that are commonly used in **data engineering** workflows.

These scripts focus on string manipulation, data structures, file handling, error management, and working with dates — all foundational skills before jumping into ETL, data pipelines, and distributed processing.

## 📌 Why This Repo?

Before diving into data pipelines, cloud, and big data frameworks like PySpark or Airflow, it's essential to:
- Write clean, testable Python code
- Understand core logic patterns
- Work with files and dates
- Handle exceptions gracefully

This repo is your warm-up lap before the real data engineering marathon. 🏁
