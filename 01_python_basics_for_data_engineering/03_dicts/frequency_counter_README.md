# Count Word Frequency

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to count the **frequency of each word** in a given string.

## Approach:
- We define a function `word_frequency()` that accepts a string as input.
- The function splits the string into individual words.
- A dictionary is then created where each word is a key, and its count is the corresponding value.

### Example:
Input: `"Data Engineering with Python Python"`

Output: `{'data': 1, 'engineering': 1, 'with': 1, 'python': 2}`

## How to Run:
```bash
python dicts/frequency_counter.py
```
