# Read and Write CSV Files

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate how to **read from and write to a CSV file** in Python.

## Approach:
- We define two functions: `write_csv()` to write data to a CSV file, and `read_csv()` to read data from a CSV file.
- The data is written as rows of a CSV file, and then read back into a list format.

### Example:
- Writing to CSV: A list of names and ages is written to a file `example.csv`.
- Reading from CSV: The contents of `example.csv` are read back and displayed.

## How to Run:
```bash
python files/read_write_csv.py
```
