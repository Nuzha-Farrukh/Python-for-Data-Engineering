# Extract Vowels from a String

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to **extract all vowels** (both uppercase and lowercase) from a given string.

## Approach:
- We define a function `extract_vowels()` that takes a string as input.
- The function iterates through each character in the string.
- If the character is a vowel (i.e., one of 'aeiou' or 'AEIOU'), it is added to a result list.
- The final list of vowels is returned.

### Example:
Input: `"Data Engineering with Python"`

Output: `['a', 'a', 'e', 'i', 'e', 'i', 'o']`

## How to Run:
```bash
python strings/extract_vowels.py
```
