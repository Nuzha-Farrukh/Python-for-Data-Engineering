# Square Even Numbers Using List Comprehension

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to square all **even numbers** in a given list.

## Approach:
- We define a function `square_even_numbers()` that accepts a list of numbers.
- Using a list comprehension, we iterate over the numbers and square those that are even.

### Example:
Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`

Output: `[4, 16, 36]`

## How to Run:
```bash
python comprehensions/square_even_numbers.py
```
