# Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
#     Equals: a == b
#     Not Equals: a != b
#     Less than: a < b
#     Less than or equal to: a <= b
#     Greater than: a > b
#     Greater than or equal to: a >= b

a = "shamas"
b = "imran"
if b == a:
  print("b is equal to a")

if b != a:
  print("b is not equal to a")

# Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code.
# Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
# If statement, without indentation (will raise an error):
# if b == a:
# print("b is equal to a")
